				I am currently a sophomore at WPI majoring in Computer Science and 
				I am looking for summer internship opportunities for this coming summer. 
				I have taken classes such as Systems Programming Concepts, Introduction to 
				Machine Organization and the Assembly Language, and Computer Networks, and was 
				able to work on projects such as a simple cache simulator and a program that
				 implemented a distance vector routing protocol. In my free time, I enjoy
				 creating artwork, which I have linked on the personal website I created.
